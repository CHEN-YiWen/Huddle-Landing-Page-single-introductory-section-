## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- I played around with <code>display: flex</code>. I think I am getting more familiar with it.

- It is really easy to add icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

- I tried a new way to turn the font size of <code>h1</code> into a responsive one by using <code>font-size= (number)vw</code>. I think the result is pretty good.

```css
    h1{
        font-size: 3vw;
      }
```

### Continued development

- The position of the background doesn't look the same as the design. I will try to play around with it more to achieve a similar result. 

- I still need to figure out how to make the main image more responsive to the changing width of the browser.

### Useful resources

- [How TO - Responsive Text](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_text.asp) - A short explanation for making the text responsive.
